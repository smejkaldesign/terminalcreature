  hatch [--from-zero] open the egg; --from-zero starts at 0 instead of scoring
        [--name <n>]  what you've already written. --name names it as it opens
  names               two fresh name ideas, for naming an egg before it opens

  config <key> <val>  set one (provider, vault_root, xp_max, density, columns, sprite_height, unicode, border, hidden, update_check, hookcard)
     hookcard is always, changes (the default: a card when the session's xp or stage
     moved, else every 10th turn) or off

  sources             what it can count, and what to do if that's nothing
  doctor [--check]    check what terminalcreature can see; --check also asks pypi
  hosts               the support table: every host it can draw in, how each is
                      detected, and which are here and wired
  update [--apply]    ask pypi whether there's a newer terminalcreature; --apply installs it
  install [--host <h>] [--inline|--box] [--statusline <cmd>]
                      wire every host found on this machine: a statusline host
                      (claude, cursor, copilot, qwen, droid) gets the creature in
                      its statusline, wrapping what it ran before; a card host
                      (codex, gemini, vibe, auggie, opencode, amp) gets a one-line
                      card after each turn through its hook or plugin channel.
                      --host <name> does one host. --inline puts the creature after
                      the host's text, --box on the left as a column; each host
                      has its own default. install.sh does the full claude setup
                      and ends by running this
  uninstall [--host <h>]
                      put every wired host back: statusline restored and shim
                      dropped, or the hook entry or plugin file taken out.
                      --host <name> does one host
  hookcard --host <h> what the hook runs: reads the host's JSON on stdin, credits
                      session xp, prints the card in the host's reply shape

update and doctor --check are the only commands that go online, and only when
you run them. Everything else, the statusline included, is offline.

provider is auto (the default: agents when two or more coding agents are
installed, else claude), agents (every agent's memory, sessions and rules:
Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Qwen, Droid, opencode, Amp, Goose,
Continue, Kiro, Cline, Crush), claude (stock Claude Code memory), vault (a
structured vault) or folder (any directory of markdown, set vault_root to
point at it).
