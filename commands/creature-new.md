# /creature-new

Lay a fresh egg. **Ask which mode first, then run the matching command.** Never guess, and
never pass a mode the user didn't pick.

Show them the current buddy and the two options:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$HOME/.claude/terminalcreature/lib" python3 -m terminalcreature.cli list
```

| They want | Run |
| --- | --- |
| a clean start, done with the current one | `new --replace [name]` |
| another buddy, keeping the current one | `new --add [name]` |

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$HOME/.claude/terminalcreature/lib" python3 -m terminalcreature.cli new --replace
```

If there's no buddy yet, there's nothing to replace. Just run `new` and skip the question.

## Show the egg

`new` ends on the egg drawn in its box, the same container the statusline uses. **Print that
output as-is, inside a code block**, so the art keeps its alignment and the first thing they
see is the egg they just laid. Don't paraphrase it into a sentence, and don't run `list`
afterwards in its place: the roster is one glyph and a dash, not the egg.

## Replace keeps the old one

`--replace` retires, it doesn't delete. The old buddy stays in `list` with its banked XP and
`focus <name>` brings it back. Say that when you confirm, because "replace" sounds destructive
and people brace for losing their level.

## Add warns first, on purpose

`--add` always asks first, at any level, and prints why: a new egg starts at 0 and takes focus,
so the current buddy holds its level and stops gaining. Relay that, get a yes, then re-run with
`--yes`. Don't add `--yes` pre-emptively; the refusal is the confirmation step.

There's no level threshold. The tradeoff is identical at level 12 and level 99, so don't tell
anyone they have to reach 100 first.

## Naming

Don't name it here. An egg renders as Unhatched everywhere, and the name is chosen during
`/creature-hatch` (two ideas from `terminalcreature names`, their own, or let it name itself).
Laying the egg and naming what's inside are different moments; keep them apart.

## Rules

- **Never print a filesystem path from a memory directory.** Same rule as `/creature`.
- Don't hatch it for them. `new` leaves an egg on purpose; opening it is `/creature-hatch`.
- A new egg feeds while it's closed, so there's no rush to hatch and no XP lost by waiting.
